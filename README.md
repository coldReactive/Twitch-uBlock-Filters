# Twitch-uBlock-Filters
Twitch uBlock Filters that don't use a UserScript JS File. Most, if not all of the filters listed in the file are from Reddit. The filters should only be blocking some annoyances and certain parts of twitch. They shouldn't block most, if any, ads. To properly block ads, you will need a special UserScript from a repository like https://github.com/pixeltris/TwitchAdSolutions

On uBlock Origin's Filters List page, import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coldReactive/Twitch-uBlock-Filters/main/filters.txt
